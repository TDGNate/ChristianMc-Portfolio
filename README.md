# Christian McIlvenny's Portfolio

First Created On 5/26/2022

# Highlights

The purpose of this project is to show employers my experience and accomplishments through an appealing portfolio. My portfolio presents my name, age, and how I began this journey as a Software Engineer.

I built this website with HTML and CSS using Flexbox, grid, and a few Media Queries for different device sizes (Mobile > Tablet > Desktop). I've also added a contact section using Font Awesome for the icons, and below I added a footer with all the links that helped me achieve my website's look!
